            <h4>What is Client to Client (C2C) ?</h4>
            <p>
              Client to client (C2C) is a plan of action whereby clients can exchange with one another, normally in an online climate.

            <h4>How Client to Client (C2C) works</h4>
            <p>
              C2C addresses a market climate where one client buys merchandise from another client utilizing an outsider business or stage to work with the exchange. C2C organizations are a sort of plan of action that arose with web-based business innovation and the sharing economy. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Clients profit with the opposition for items and regularly discover things that are hard to find somewhere else. Additionally, edges can be higher than customary estimating techniques for merchants on the grounds that there are insignificant expenses because of the shortfall of retailers or wholesalers. C2C locales are helpful on the grounds that there is no compelling reason to visit a physical store. Merchants list their items on the web, and the purchasers come to them.
